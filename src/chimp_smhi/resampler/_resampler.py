    """Resamples the given SEVIRI native file (opened with fsspec) given an area file and storage options.

    Args:
        fs_file:
            The input file (of type ``FSFile``) to resample.
        output_directory:
            The directory where the output file is to be saved.
        area:
            Either a filename (Path) or an object (AreaDefinition) which holds the area information according to which
            the data will be resampled. Defaults to :obj:`chimp.areas.NORDICS_4`.
        channel_names:
            The list of channels to load from the file. Defaults to
            ``satpy.readers.seviri_base.CHANNEL_NAMES.values()``.
        output_filename_generator:
            A function using which an output filename will be generated from the given input filename
            (SEVIRI native file). The generated filename must end in ``".nc"`` and it is used to store the
            resampled file. The generated output filename will be prefixed with ``output_path`` to compose a
            fully-qualified path for the output file.
        radius_of_influence:
            An integer which marks the search radius (in meters) for neighbouring data points. Defaults to ``20000``.
        remove_file_if_exists:
            Removes the output file first if it already exists. This might save us from some issues regrading
            files being overwritten and corrupted.
        save_datasets_options:
            Storage options using which the dataset is to be saved. The default behaviour is to use ``cf`` as the writer
            and exclude longitude and latitude values, i.e.
            ``save_datasets_options = dict(writer="cf", include_lonlats=False)``

        ValueError:
            If the generated output filename does not end with ``.nc``.
